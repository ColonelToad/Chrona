Docs consolidated: active working notes are in /notes/ (git-ignored). The docs folder now keeps only archival references when needed.

For current info:
- notes/model-data.md — models, datasets, tier plans
- notes/llm-rag.md — LLM loading, prompts, RAG/memory plan
- notes/ui-extras.md — UI behaviors and upcoming UX

For quick starts and overviews, use README.md and GET_STARTED.md at repo root.
