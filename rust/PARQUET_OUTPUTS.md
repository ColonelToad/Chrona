# Parquet Output Verification

The following Parquet files were generated by the ingestion pipeline:

- sensor_data_4_BusinessProfessional.parquet
- sensor_data_5_CollegeStudent.parquet
- sensor_data_6_ProAthlete.parquet
- sensor_data_7_ShiftWorker.parquet
- sensor_data_8_RemoteWorker.parquet

Each file contains 60 rows of synthetic sensor data for the corresponding user profile/session.

To inspect Parquet files, use tools like:
- [parquet-tools](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/tree/master/parquet-tools)
- [Python pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html)
- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) (e.g., `SELECT * FROM 'sensor_data_4_BusinessProfessional.parquet' LIMIT 5;`)
